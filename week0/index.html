            <h3 id="r1">Ancient City of Damascus (Arabic: دمشق القديمة)</h3>
            <p>Founded in the 3rd millennium B.C., Damascus is one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. In the Middle Ages, it was the centre of a flourishing craft industry, specializing in swords and lace. The city has some 125 monuments from different periods of its history – one of the most spectacular is the 8th-century Great Mosque of the Umayyads, built on the site of an Assyrian sanctuary.</p>

            <h3 id="r2">The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: جامع بني أمية الكبير)</h3>
            <p>The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus , located in the old city of Damascus, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. It is considered by some Muslims to be the fourth-holiest place in Islam. After the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica dedicated to John the Baptist (Yahya), honored as a prophet by Christians and Muslims. A legend dating to the 6th century holds that the building contains the head of John the Baptist. The mosque is also believed by Muslims to be the place where Jesus (Isa) will return at the End of Days. The mausoleum containing the tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque.</p>

            <p>Azm Palace is a palace in Damascus, Syria which dates back to the days of the Ottoman Empire. Located north of Al-Buzuriyah Souq in the Ancient City of Damascus, the palace was built in 1749 and was the private residence for As'ad Pasha al-Azm, the governor of Damascus, and during the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon it housed the French Institute. After being purchased by the Syrian government from the Azm family and undergoing several reconstruction works, the palace now houses the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.</p>
